# diamondglass
I wanted a really strong glass but without adding a mod that added lots of other stuff I didn't need. 

You craft 8 sand with 1 diamond to get diamond sand, a seamless block with the attributes of sand that you can place in your world. If you smelt it, you will get a semi-seamless glass block that has the tint of diamond, the toughness of obsidian and it's blast resistance. Making it ideal for caging live dragons from the Ice and Fire mod.

Use it however you like. 

Known issue:

You can see the borders between the blocks, I don't want this, when I learn how to make that go away, the next version will come out. But for now this is good enough.
Made with MCreator 1.7.5

I am currently rewriting it in eclipse right now.
